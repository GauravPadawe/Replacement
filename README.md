To minimize errors when writing long texts with complicated expressions you could replace the tricky parts with a marker.

Write a program that takes a line of text and finds the first occurrence of a certain marker and replaces it with a replacement text. 
The resulting line of text should be stored in a variable. All input data will be given as variables.

Replace the first occurrence of marker in the line.
There will be at least one occurrence of the marker in the
line of text. Put the answer in the variable 'replaced'.
